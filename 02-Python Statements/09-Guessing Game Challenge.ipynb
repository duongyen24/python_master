    "1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF BOUNDS\"\r\n",
    "2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is\r\n",
    " * within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\r\n",
    " * further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\r\n",

    " * closer to the number than the previous guess return \"WARMER!\"\r\n",
